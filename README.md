Food adulteration is a constant worry for Indian households. While simple, scientifically valid tests exist to check for common adulterants at home (e.g., detecting metanil yellow in turmeric powder with acid), most people don't know them or are unsure if they're doing them correctly.
An AI-powered guide that walks you through simple home purity tests and verifies the results.
The user selects what they want to test. The app provides simple, step-by-step video instructions for a known test.
Here's the AI magic: After the user performs the test, they point their phone's camera at the result. The AI uses color analysis and computer vision to confirm the outcome. For instance, it will detect if the turmeric solution turned pink/violet and display: "Result: Adulteration Likely. This color change indicates the presence of metanil yellow."
